Presentation of the RStudio and Git session.

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that facilitate the life of R users. We will show some of the tools that are provided by the RStudio IDE that could help you save some precious time and effort. Two of these tools are the integration of Git and the R projects. We will see in particular how these two tools are integrated in RStudio and how much is it important to work with them. Make sure you have the latest version of RStudio and git installed (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN).
